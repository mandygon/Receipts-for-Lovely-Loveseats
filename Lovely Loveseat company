1. Let’s add in our first item, the Lovely Loveseat that is the store’s namesake. 
Create a variable called lovely_loveseat_description and assign to it the following string:

Example """ Lovely Loveseat. 
Tufted polyester blend on wood. 
32 inches high x 40 inches wide x 30 inches deep. 
Red or white. """

Hint assign a variable_name = "This is a string" or use a multi-string with 3 quotation marks """ """

2. Great, now let’s create a price for the loveseat. 
Create a variable lovely_loveseat_price and set it equal to 254.00.

Hint = Assign the variable same as the string before, but leave out the quotes since we’re storing a number:
Example:  numeric_variable = 10.00

3. Let’s extend our inventory with another characteristic piece of furniture! 
Create a variable called stylish_settee_description and assign to it the following string:

Example """ Stylish Settee. 
Faux leather on birch. 29.50 inches high x 54.75 inches wide x 28 inches deep. 
Black. """


4. Now let’s set the price for our Stylish Settee. 
Create a variable stylish_settee_price and assign it the value of 180.50.

HINT = Assign the variable same as the string before, but leave out the quotes since we’re storing a number:
Example:  numeric_variable = 10.00

5. Fantastic, we just need one more item before we’re ready for business. 
Create a new variable called luxurious_lamp_description and assign it the following:

Example """ Luxurious Lamp. 
Glass and iron. 
36 inches tall. 
Brown with cream shade. """


6. Let’s set the price for this item. Create a variable called luxurious_lamp_price and set it equal to 52.15.

HINT = Assign the variable same as the string before, but leave out the quotes since we’re storing a number:
Example:  numeric_variable = 10.00

7. In order to be a business, we should also be calculating sales tax. Let’s store the sales tax in a variable.

Example: sales_tax = .088

Define the variable sales_tax and set it equal to .088. That’s 8.8%.

Now its time to checkout our First Customer

8.Our first customer is making their purchase! Let’s keep a running tally of their expenses by defining a variable called customer_one_total. 
Since they haven’t purchased anything yet, let’s set that variable equal to 0 for now.
Example: customer_one_total = 0

9. We should also keep a list of the descriptions of things they’re purchasing. 
Create a variable called customer_one_itemization and set that equal to the empty string "". 
We’ll tack on the descriptions to this as they make their purchases.

Example: customer_one_itemization = ""

HINT - An empty string is a string without any characters in it. Assign it just like any other variable:

empty_string = ""


10. Our customer has decided they are going to purchase our Lovely Loveseat! Add the price to customer_one_total.

Hint - The price for the loveseat is saved in lovely_loveseat_price. Add it to the total like so:

Example: customer_one_total += lovely_loveseat_price


11. Let’s start keeping track of the items our customer purchased. Add the description of the Lovely Loveseat to customer_one_itemization.

Hint - The description is in the lovely_loveseat_description variable. 
Recall you can use the plus-equals operator to add strings to an existing variable.

Example: customer_one_itemization += lovely_loveseat_description



12. Our customer has also decided to purchase the Luxurious Lamp! Let’s add the price to the customer’s total.

Hint - Add luxurious_lamp_price to customer_one_total.

Example: luxurious_lamp_price += customer_one_total.


13. Let’s keep the itemization up-to-date and add the description of the Luxurious Lamp to our itemization.

Example: customer_one_itemization += luxurious_lamp_description 

14. They’re ready to check out! Let’s begin by calculating sales tax. 
Create a variable called customer_one_tax and set it equal to customer_one_total times sales_tax.

Hint - Multiplication uses the * operator.

Example: customer_one_tax = customer_one_total * sales_tax


15.Add the sales tax to the customer’s total cost.
Hint - Update the variable customer_one_total by adding customer_one_tax to it.
Example: customer_one_total += customer_one_tax



16. Let’s start printing up their receipt! Begin by printing out the heading for their itemization. 
Print the phrase "Customer One Items:"

Example: print("Customer One Items: ")


17. Now add customer_one_itemization to print(You can also do this with a comma).

Example: print("Customer One Items: " + customer_one_itemization )


18. Now add a heading for their total cost: Print out "Customer One Total:"
print("Customer One Total: ")

19. Now print out their total! Our first customer now has a receipt for the things they purchased. (You can also do this with a comma)
print("Customer One Total: " + str(customer_one_total))


20. Congratulations! We created our catalog and served our first customer.
We used our knowledge of strings and numbers to create and update variables. 
We were able to print out an itemized list and a total cost for our customer. Lovely!
